## Process                                                                              
The dashboard follows a clear and logical analysis flow. It begins by providing overall HR KPIs, followed by breakdowns of employee demographics and departmental distributions, and then delves into attrition-specific insights. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of workforce composition and attrition patterns.                                       
-Start with key HR metrics including attrition rate, total employee count, average salary, and gender ratio.                                                         
-Analyze demographic details such as age group, gender, marital status, and education field.                                                               
-Assess departmental data to identify areas with high attrition.                                                                
-Evaluate job roles, job satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and years at company.                                                       
-Identify patterns and trends that may contribute to attrition.

-Attrition rates vary across departments, with Sales (21%), R&D (19%), and HR (14%) having the highest rates.                                                      
-Among job roles, Sales Representatives (40%), Laboratory Technicians (24%), and Human Resources Specialists (23%) have the highest attrition rates.                              
-Employees who travel frequently for business have a higher attrition rate (25%) compared to those who rarely travel (8%).                    
-Employees who are dissatisfied with their jobs have a higher attrition rate (23%) compared to those who are satisfied (11%).                                            
-The average age of employees facing attrition is 34.                                                            
-Attrition rates vary significantly based on job satisfaction levels; employees with lower job satisfaction have higher attrition rates.                              
-Single employees face a higher rate of attrition compared to married or divorced employees.                                          

## Conclusion:
This HR dashboard effectively brings out key insights related to employee attrition. By focusing on satisfaction metrics, departmental churn, and employee demographics, HR teams can make informed decisions to improve employee retention and engagement.                                                                                        

**Recommendations:**
